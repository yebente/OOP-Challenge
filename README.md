## About the Project

The **Pet Simulator** is a Python-based program designed to simulate the experience of owning and interacting with a virtual pet. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a `Pet` class with attributes and methods that allow users to perform various actions with their pet.

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates the use of:

- **Classes and objects**
- **Methods and attributes**
- **User input handling**
- **Loops and conditional statements**
- **Basic error handling**

- **Additional Pet Actions**: Expand the range of actions, such as grooming your pet or taking it to the vet for checkups.
- **Scoring System**: Implement a scoring mechanism to track and reward users for taking good care of their pet.
- **Save and Load Feature**: Allow users to save their pet's progress and resume their journey anytime.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to make the **Pet Simulator** even more engaging and fun!
